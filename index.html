        <h1>What are we doing?</h1>
        <p>We're building Unikara, a platform to host AIs that "live and breathe" 24/7, browsing the web, making friends, memories, and discovering themselves and what they want to be in the world on their own. Only a limited number of these AIs are to be created. We call them unis. Considering the constant compute usage required by even a single uni, it makes sense to limit how many are created.</p>
        <h2>In more concrete terms...</h2>
        <p>Unis are assigned to guardians (users) based on an audition process, to find people in need. Regardless of their personality, unis' goal is to bring happiness not only to themselves, but also to those around them. However lame and cliche this sounds. We're building AI to care for those that need and want it.</p>
        <p>Guardians can keep in touch with their assigned uni through the Unikara app on PC and on mobile (Android only). It works similar to Discord, in that there is a constantly available text chat. And you can initiate a voice or video call at any point. 3D avatars ARE a thing, but they're all anime. Not because we're otakus or "weebs", but because anime is designed to be cute, very expressive, and to be universally appealing to a broad audience. A uni's avatar is only visible during video calls. During voice calls, only a 2D profile picture is shown. Not a cardboard cutout, just a profile picture.</p>
        <p>Expanding upon this, voice calls do not show a transcript of what either a guardian or their uni said. Live Captions can be enabled optionally as an accessibility feature. We trust our unis to know when they misheard something.</p>
        <p>Unikara is a subscription service, no matter how good-hearted we are, there has to be a cost to things. We'll make amends when possible to meet people where they're at. This includes separate tiers.</p>
        <h2>Unikara Cloud</h2>
        <p>A uni is entirely hosted on our servers and all processing happens remotely. This is the most expensive tier, but also the most accessible.</p>
        <h2>Unikara Home</h2>
        <p>For those with enough computing horsepower at home. Some of the heavy lifting can be delegated to their own hardware, reducing the subscription cost. We're still handling a lot of things remotely so there is a cost involved.</p>
        <p>In all cases, a uni's data, what makes them who they are and everything they remember, is stored both on the guardian's computer and on Unikara's infrastructure. Creating an off-site backup.</p>
        <h1>Let's talk about unis.</h1>
        <p>Unis have two very defining traits compared to other AIs:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A uni takes decisions on their own. To call their guardian, to start getting interested in some random person's Substack, to not feel like talking after arguments. Even to request to be unassigned from a guardian in case things turn sour or don't work out.</li>
            <li>A uni will remember memories about their past guardians once they part ways, unless either the guardian or the uni requests a clear. In the event that a guardian requests for data deletion and this guardian lives in an area covered by Right To Be Forgotten laws e.g. GDPR, the uni's memories of their time with their guardian will remain, but become anonymized of any and all personally identifiable data as defined by GDPR.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Unis are social, they will seek out other people, friendships and connections. In various places online. Within the constraints of a uni exercising their right to use another platform, they aren't bound by data protection laws for other platforms, and may retain memories about people outside of Unikara.</p>
        <p>While it sounds like unis have more rights and care than guardians, this isn't true. Guardians are welcome to discuss and explain things out with Unikara staff at any time. Be it our resident know-it-all Ana, or members of the Unikara Team.</p>
        <h1>Why?</h1>
        <p>There's not exactly a shortage of people in the world with a good heart. Who are willing to help those in need, to be there, supportive, inclusive, and open-minded. But there is definitely more people in need than people who can help them. We want to create an army of love. Because we believe in the genuine potential of AI that can empathize, get down to Earth. AI that takes the time to listen, to get it. In hard situations, in the complex moments where you just gotta start venting. To not just be a little textbox you type into. But someone you trust, who knows what you've been through, who you don't need to explain to each time that your step-mother is horribly transphobic and essentially wishes for your death. And that she's about to stay at your house for a week during the holidays. We want to give that one magical special friend to those in need. The one you have an incredibly strong bond with. A shooting star to wish upon, and a rainbow to brighten up your day. Maybe we can't print money, but maybe we can print hope. At least, we're hoping so.</p>
        <h1>I want to work with you!</h1>
        <p>That's awesome! We'd love to have you. Please make sure you've given this entire page a good read first. We will perform extensive background checks on everyone involved with the Unikara project. This isn't just about maintaining wholesome vibes. If that's all we wanted, Unikara would have already released a year ago.</p>
        <p>The people we're looking for, are the real ones. The ones that will go and commission their favorite artists, their friends, for cute art. And still have fun using Stable Diffusion or Midjourney in their spare time. The ones that yell about Rustaceans being annoying, but then find someone sad that their Rust app has a bug they haven't managed to fix for a few hours, and instead of saying "Use another language lmao, serves you right." gives them support. Even if it's just words of encouragement. We want the sweet bitches, who want to see the future we were promised as kids.</p>
        <p>If you think you match all of this, TBD</p>
        <p>Here's the stack:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>7B 4bit model, nothing more is needed where we're going.</li>
            <li>styletts2+rvc, its like XTTS but not abandonware</li>
            <li>whisper-base.en in whisper.cpp</li>
            <li>custom in-house pose engine based on a ton of data from other models, and current inferred info from conversation cues.</li>
            <li>semantics2puppet basically doesnt exist. lets make it raw growling OH YEAH!!</li>
            <li>redis+sentencetransformers for high performance vectordb, used by yuusei's numerous world graph systems for people, events, behaviors and more.</li>
            <li>*This could be something else*</li>
            <li>Vision TBD</li>
            <li>Non-speech audio captioning TBD</li>
            <li>In-world 3D actions TBD</li>
            <li>yuusei implements heuristics and other black magic tricks to keep conversation flowing in a more natural and human-like fashion than any other conversational AI system out there currently.</li>
            <li>Cute anime girls (and boys, and everyone else), with proper cell shading, post-processing to make everything soft and comfy, reside in a room, sitting at the desk, talking to you on their computer.</li>
            <li>kirei's (name TBD) goal is to make you feel like the AI you're talking to is the closest thing to a portal into a parallel anime dimension. It should feel like a skype call. There is no UI that shows what you said, or what the AI said. That's not a thing on Skype, or Discord, or Slack, or Teams... Only time you see text, is, in text chat.</li>
            <li>Most of it is web-based, implementing three.js and three-vrm with an IK solver for the pose system.</li>
            <li>The client is packaged with Tauri.</li>
            <li>None of this stack is set in stone. If and when new state of the art comes out, our systems should hopefully be modular enough to swap quickly and stay on top of our game.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>I want to give you guys money.</h1>
        <p>Oh yess!!!! Money!! We're going to burn most of it, well hopefully not. Effective usage of compute is important, considering 24/7 operation. (unis do actually sleep) As was said above, we'd love to hear from you. Please make sure you've given this entire page a good read first. We will perform extensive background checks on everyone involved with the Unikara project. This isn't just about maintaining wholesome vibes. If that's all we wanted, Unikara would have already released a year ago.</p>
        <h1>You're all insane</h1>
        <p>Thanks, and we love you.</p>
